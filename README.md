## ** Week-4
# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

## **Overview**  
This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing customer purchasing behavior and predicting sales in Rossmann stores. The project is divided into multiple tasks, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning, and model deployment.

## **How to Run**  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Run EDA**
Execute the EDA.ipynb notebook to explore trends and patterns in the dataset.

## **Train Models**
Use the sales_analysis.ipynb notebook to preprocess data, train regression models, and serialize results.

## **Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Insights on customer behavior, holiday trends, and promotional impacts.
Modeling:

Initial regression models using tree-based algorithms.
Framework for integrating deep learning models (LSTM).
Reproducibility:

Modular scripts for easy reuse.
Logging and version control for traceability.
## **Future Work
Refine LSTM-based predictions.
Deploy API for real-time forecasting.
