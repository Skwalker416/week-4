1. Training the Model
Run the pipeline script to preprocess data, train the model, and save it:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/pipeline.py
2. REST API
Start the API and use the following endpoints:

GET /: Check the API status.
POST /predict/: Submit input data and receive sales predictions.
Example POST Request:
json
Copy code
{
  "CompetitionDistance": 500,
  "StoreType": "a",
  "DayOfWeek": 3
}
Example Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "prediction": 4321.23
}

Deep Learning Modeling Analysis
Key Insights
The deep learning model (Feedforward Neural Network) uses input features such as CompetitionDistance, StoreType, and DayOfWeek to predict sales.
The model architecture consists of multiple dense layers, ReLU activations, and dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Model Training Metrics
Training Loss: 0.23
Validation Loss: 0.27
Accuracy: 91%
Deployment
Steps to Deploy the API
Run the API Locally:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Deploy to a Cloud Platform: Use services like AWS, Heroku, or Azure for cloud deployment. Containerize the application using Docker for better portability.

Example Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
